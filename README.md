## DBSCAN: Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise

Given a set of points in some space, DBSCAN algorithm groups together points that are closely packed together (points with many nearby neighbors), marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions (whose nearest neighbors are too far away) [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN). The "nearby neighbors" are filtered according to the distance between two data points.  

The current python script is a DBSCAN clustering algorithm with "customized distance measurements." In other words, besides traditional Euclidean distance, this code also allows user to use custom distance matrix as input. This dbscan algorithm with custom distance measurements are for those cases when novel distance measurements are used in calculation. _sklearn.cluster.DBSCAN_ can also do this if set _metric="precomputed"_.

See [Instruction](#instruction) for details and instructions of this script.
