## Installation <a name="installation"></a>

The libraries used in this analysis process include: pandas, math, and collections.

The code should run with no issues using Python versions 3.*.

## Project Motivation<a name="motivation"></a>

The current python code is for dbscan clustering method with "customized distance measurements." In other words, besides traditional Euclidean distance, this code also allows user to use custom distance matrix as input.

This dbscan algorithm with custom distance measurements are for those cases when novel distance measurements are used in calculation.


## File Descriptions <a name="files"></a>

DBSCAN_custom.py includes a class function for this algorithm. 

## Instruction<a name="instruction"></a>

TO BE UPDATED.
