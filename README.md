## DBSCAN: Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise

Given a set of points in some space, DBSCAN algorithm groups together points that are closely packed together (points with many nearby neighbors), marking as outliers points that lie alone in low-density regions (whose nearest neighbors are too far away) [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBSCAN). The "nearby neighbors" are filtered according to the distance between two data points.  
The DBSCAN algorithm in existing packages such as sklearn allows users to select a certain distance measurement method, e.g., the Euclidean distance. Yet, in cases when customized distance measurements are used, these packages are not applicable.   
The current python script is a DBSCAN clustering algorithm with "customized distance measurements." In other words, besides traditional Euclidean distance, this code also allows user to use custom distance matrix as input. See [Instruction](#instruction) for details and instructions of this script. This dbscan algorithm with custom distance measurements are for those cases when novel distance measurements are used in calculation.
