# DBSCAN: Density Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise

# The code is on the base of choffstein's dbscan code (authors: Martin Ester, Hans-Peter Kriegel, JÃ¶rg Sander, Xiaowei Xu).
# The current python code is for dbscan clustering method with "customized distance measurements,"
# i.e., besides traditional Euclidean distance, this code also allows user to use custom distance matrix as input.
# This dbscan algorithm with custom distance measurements are for those cases when novel distance measurements are used
